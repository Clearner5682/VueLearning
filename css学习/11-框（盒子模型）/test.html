        All of us know a truth that parents do love their children . 
        They even help children to do everything about their sudies and lives. 
        Moreover, children can't do some simple things by themselves and they forget to love other people in return. 
        Therefore, children will have less abilities to analyse and solve problems without their parents and this will causes them to become useless and enable to take care of themselves. 
        In order to develope dependence ability of the children,parents should do something to help with it. 
        Firstly,they are supposed to encourage their children to do something by themselves,such as washing socks,doing the dishes or making instant noodles.Secondly, parents should produce some opportunities for their children about the living skills. 
        For example,if a family is going to have a picnic,parents can let their children make the plan,and parents also can give some advice.Thirdly,give them full room to do things alone. 
        Children will have a better life without parents' help.That is vital of importance.
